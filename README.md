## Introduction:
We are Datart. We will be mapping the public art around the Los Angeles County. Although Los Angeles is known to be a culturally rich city, not many people know about the art that surrounds them. We hope to create a website that bring awareness to users about the diverse arts and culture that encompasses Los Angeles.

## Overview:
Public art installations are important to promote a community's identity and culture, as well as help to acknowledge the work of local artists. Our website, Datart, aims to visualize public art installations through mapping. Compiling three datasets of spatial data and metadata of different public art installations, we were able to illustrate the location, title, artist name, year, and image for each art piece. Specifically, we chose to focus on the Los Angeles County because as students at UCLA, we are interested in exploring more of the art/culture that surrounds the area.  Our website will serve as a guide that helps users discover the richness of LA's culture that surrounds them, through mapping.

## Methodology:
Mapping is a great visualization method of location-based data. Given that we want to showcase public art around Los Angeles, we think web mapping will be a fun, interactive way for users to enjoy our content. Mapping has advantages over traditional charts and graphs in that it is extremely versatile in incorporating multi-dimensional data, including spatial and temporal variables. We hope this will allow users to get a deeper understanding of the significance of public art installations in relation to where they exist around LA.

## Technical scope:
Git: sharing code between each other  
Leaflet: needed for generating the maproom 
HTML: publishing the map online  
Javascript: need to code in Javascript to work with Leaflet, increase interactivity  
CSS: stylize the page  
Figma: storyboardings and planning UI/UX website components

## Geographic scope: 
We will be focusing on the Los Angeles County because as students at UCLA, it is a relevant location of interest among us, and we are interested in exploring more of the art/culture that surrounds the area.
