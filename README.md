## Introduction:
We are Datart. We will be mapping the public art around the Los Angeles County. Although Los Angeles is known to be a culturally rich city, not many people know about the art that surrounds them. We hope to create a website that bring awareness to users about the diverse arts and culture that encompasses Los Angeles.

## Overview:
Our group's project will focus on introducing public art installations around the Los Angeles area by combining multiple datasets. As we did some initial research, we found that there wasn't a comprehensive resource that visualized and clearly described this information. Thus, we think this is an important project because our mapping website can be an illustrative guide to people who want to explore more around the city, especially given that LA is a popular travel destination.

## Methodology:
Mapping is a great visualization method of location-based data. Given that we want to showcase public art around Los Angeles, we think web mapping will be a fun, interactive way for users to enjoy our content. Mapping has advantages over traditional charts and graphs in that it is extremely versatile in incorporating multi-dimensional data, including spatial and temporal variables. We hope this will allow users to get a deeper understanding of the significance of public art installations in relation to where they exist around LA.

## Technical scope:
Git: sharing code between each other  
Leaflet: needed for mapping  
HTML: publishing the map online  
Javascript: need to code in Javascript to work with Leaflet, increase interactivity  
CSS: stylize the page

## Geographic scope: 
We will be focusing on the Los Angeles County because as students at UCLA, we are interested in exploring more of the art/culture that surrounds the area.
