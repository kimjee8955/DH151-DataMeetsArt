## Introduction: Come up with a group name, and write a short description about what your group is for/about.
Our group name is DataMeetsArt. Our group is looking to map public art in Los Angeles County. 
## Team members: Introduce each member of the team (include a photo/avatar), their titles, roles, and a short blurb.
Annmarie Cong: UX/UI for the website<br/>
Eustina Kim: Map Specialist<br/>
Michelle Lee: Data Specialist<br/>
## Overview: Introduce the group project by stating what it is that you are investigating, and why this is a matter of importance.
Our group's project will focus on introducing public art installations around the Los Angeles area by combining multiple datasets. This is important because the map can be a comprehensive guide to people who want to explore around the city. 
## Methodology: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.
We chose web mapping as a method because it can best show the locations of the public art.
## Workflow: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.
