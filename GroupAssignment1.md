# Datart
## Introduction:
We are Datart. We will be mapping the public art around the Los Angeles County. Although Los Angeles is known to be a culturally rich city, not many people know about the art that surrounds them. We hope to create a website that bring awareness to users about the diverse arts and culture that encompasses Los Angeles.
## Team members: Introduce each member of the team (include a photo/avatar), their titles, roles, and a short blurb.

## Overview: Introduce the group project by stating what it is that you are investigating, and why this is a matter of importance.
Our group's project will focus on introducing public art installations around the Los Angeles area by combining multiple datasets. This is important because the map can be a comprehensive guide to people who want to explore around the city. 
## Methodology: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.
We chose web mapping as a method because it can best show the locations of the public art.
## Workflow: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.

## Technical scope: Introduce the technologies that project will use (Git, Leaflet, HTML, Javascript, etc) and what role each one will play (a diagram might be helpful)
Git: sharing code between each other
Leaflet: needed for mapping
HTML: publishing the map online
Javascript: need to code in Javascript to work with Leaflet, increase interactivity
css: stylize the page

## Geographic scope: Introduce the geographic scale that your project will take (global, USA, California, Los Angeles County, multi-scale, etc)
We will be focusing on the Los Angeles County.
