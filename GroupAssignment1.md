## Introduction: Come up with a group name, and write a short description about what your group is for/about.
Our group name is ------. Our group is looking at the relationship between COVID-19 and public transportation in LA. 
## Team members: Introduce each member of the team (include a photo/avatar), their titles, roles, and a short blurb.
## Overview: Introduce the group project by stating what it is that you are investigating, and why this is a matter of importance.
Our group's project will focus on visualizing the progression of LA public transportation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic is important because many people, especially commuters those without cars, use public transportation on a daily basis and have been affected by fewer transportation routes due to COVID-19. 
## Methodology: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.
We chose web mapping as a method because it can best show changes in public tranpsortation such as how the bus routes changed over time, schedules of each bus station,etc. 
## Workflow: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.
Week 2: Complete Project Proposal
Week 3: Do background research/ Find Data
Week 4: 
## Technical scope: Introduce the technologies that project will use (Git, Leaflet, HTML, Javascript, etc) and what role each one will play (a diagram might be helpful)
Git: sharing code between each other
Leaflet: needed for mapping
HTML: publishing the map online
Javascript: need to code in Javascript to work with Leaflet, increase interactivity
css: stylize the page
## Geographic scope: Introduce the geographic scale that your project will take (global, USA, California, Los Angeles County, multi-scale, etc)
Los Angeles County
## Data: Introduce at least two datasets that will be included in the project (include links as necessary). Make sure the data is "mappable" either by manual data entry, through an API, or by downloading it.
