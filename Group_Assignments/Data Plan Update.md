## Description on How the Data Will Be Used
Our datasets will be downloaded as csv files from the links above. Each dataset has columns of latitude and longitude information for mapping location. We plan to 
use layers on the map to filter by region in LA (with colored boundaries) and by year (with different colored icons per decade). Also, each dataset contains links 
to images of public street art which we will display on the sidebar of our maproom, as users hover over the markers. Users of the site can utilize it as an interactive,
informational guide of public art around the Los Angeles area. They will also have the opportunity to share the content by retweeting hashtags that appear on
the pop-up for each art data point.
