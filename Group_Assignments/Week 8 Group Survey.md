# Week 8 Group Survey

## Group name
Datart

## Group members
Annmarie Cong, Eustina Kim, Michelle Lee

## In general, how is the group doing?
The group project has been going well. We've made progress each week according to our timeline and have begun to add additional features that we're interested in 
like a randomize function and gallery page. We communicate on a regular basis via Slack to make sure everyone on the team is updated about the progress and to 
troubleshoot issues together.

## What is the status of your code development?
In terms of code development, we are about 70% finished. We have the "meat" of the website finished, but there are still several features that we're interested in 
implementing. We also plan to improve the aesthestic of the website and make it more user-friendly to various device types (phone, tablet, computer).

## What (if any) specific problems do you need the most help with?
No problems currently, but we may ask for assistance/ideas on implementing a social media sharing feature of art pieces on Twitter or Instagram. We may also need help moving the Google Street View to the sidebar. 

## What additional features are you thinking of adding to your project?
A few features we are planning/considering to add on the project are:
1. Iteractive time slider
2. Art walk (routing between different art pieces)
3. Social Media sharing (interactivity to share art pieces via Twitter or Instagram)

## What other concerns do you have?
Our dataset is a bit outdated, so some of the art pieces don't exist anymore. We're debating between making the website a historical record of old art sites or to 
also incorporate an additional dataset with more recent art pieces. The trade-off is that the newer dataset doesn't have images of the actual site, which may create
some inconsistency in our maproom.
