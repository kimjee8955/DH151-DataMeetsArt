Although Los Angeles is known to be a culturally rich city, not many people know about the art that surrounds them. We hope to create a website that bring awareness to users about the diverse arts and culture that encompasses Los Angeles.\r ## Team members:\r <table>\r   <tr>\r     <th>Annmarie Cong</th>\r     <th>Eustina Kim</th> \r     <th>Michelle Lee</th>\r   </tr>\r   <tr>\r     <td><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/694477786131202048/829939480735645737/image0.jpg\" alt = \"avatar_Annmarie\" width=\"250\"/></td>\r     <td><img src=\"https://github.com/kimjee8955/DH151-Datart/blob/main/images/profile_Eustina.JPG\" alt = \"pic_Eustina\" width=\"250\"/></td>\r     <td><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56007288/114282980-28c8f900-99fc-11eb-887e-d67a16ef429e.png\" alt = \"avatar_Michelle\" width=\"250\"/></td>\r   </tr>\r   <tr>\r     <td><b>UX Designer</b></td>\r     <td><b>Map Specialist</b></td>\r     <td><b>Data Specialist</b></td>\r   </tr>\r   <tr>\r     <td>Annmarie is a fourth year Cognitive Science major specializing in Computing and minoring in Digital Humanities.
