Annmarie's mind map shows the overall framework of the website. It starts out with pages the website should have and branch out into more details of each page. The Crazy Eights mainly showcase drawings of features specific to each page. The group's favorite features were the randomize button that recommends art on the map to the user, and the search bar where users can search for art and artists.

Eustina's mind map shows the overall framework of the website. It starts out with pages the website should have and branch out into more details of each page. The Crazy Eights mainly showcase drawings of features mentioned in the mind map. The group's favorite features were the landing page with a button that takes the user to the maproom, and the tabs on top of the website.

Michelle's mind map shows the various aspect of the website, such as who the users are, and the general interface of the maproom. The Crazy Eights showcase more specific features such as layers, buttons, and interactivity. The group's favorite features were the map filterlayers by art type, and the side bar that includes information about the art. 

## A storyboard collection with wireframes
* Site map: An over arching wireframe of the site structure that includes all key pages
* A sketch of the maproom layout (grid size, spacing, headers/sidebars/footers, content areas, images placeholders) and its intended features (buttons, menus, etc)
* Additional sketches of specific functions/areas of the site as necessary
* Annotations: notes on aspects that are not obvious visually, such as usability elements and possible interactions
* Interactivity: use wireframes to convey interactive components

### Our Initial Sketches
We first sketched out more coherently, after our mindmap and crazy8 discussion, of how the site would look like. After these 
sketches, we discussed about the main features we would need and the features we would like to have.

### Wireframe Flow
This is the "site map" of our incoming site. It shows where each action of the user brings them.
