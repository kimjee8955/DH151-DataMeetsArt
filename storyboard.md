## Crazy eights from each group member, and brief reactions
## A storyboard collection with wireframes
* Site map: An over arching wireframe of the site structure that includes all key pages
* A sketch of the maproom layout (grid size, spacing, headers/sidebars/footers, content areas, images placeholders) and its intended features (buttons, menus, etc)
* Additional sketches of specific functions/areas of the site as necessary
* Annotations: notes on aspects that are not obvious visually, such as usability elements and possible interactions
* Interactivity: use wireframes to convey interactive components
